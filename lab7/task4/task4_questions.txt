1.What instructions evaluate “a>6”?

A: cmpl $6, -4(%ebp)

2.What happens if we delete the “jmp” instruction?

A: If the jmp instruction is deleted then the instruction in L2 is executed
   regardless if the condition specified in the cmpl instruction is met or not.
   This is essence renders the if statement useless and will result in a stack
   overflow as the integer c is continuously incremented by 2.

3.Can you rewrite the condition with “jg” in place of “jle”? Why or why not?

A: Since jg is: jump if greater and jle is: jump if less than or equal, they cannot
   be used interchangeably. This would result in a logic error within the assembly
   code because for example if the memory address pointing to a location that holds
   an integer less than 6 (like in our code) and jg was used instead jle then the
   instruction within the if statement would have been executed instead of the
   instruction within the else. Therefore resulting in the integer value of c 
   being returned incorrectly.
