I think the stack frame size of printSumRangerecursive takes a huge portion of the high address. According to my screenshot, when start = 13, the address is     0x7ffeefbff80c which is pretty high up. when start = the address is 0x7ffeefbff77c. The address is going lower. Since printsumRangeRecursive is a recursive function, it can earily go stacck overflow since the method keeps calling itself and this is bad for large input numbers.
